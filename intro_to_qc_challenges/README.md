# Intro to QC Challenges

In this folder you'll find two folders: `grovers_algorithm` and
`quantum_teleportation`. Both challenges are intended to be highly extensible
for you and your team to get creative once you've built the baseline solution
which is outlined in the python notebooks `Grovers_Challenge.ipynb` and
`quantum_teleportation.ipynb` respectively. Please make sure to make a copy of
the notebooks and work in the copy so we can avoid merge conflicts!

## qBraid-SDK

- If you've downloaded the SDK before yesterday, please delete the environment
  and redownload as we have added updates.

You guys are one of the first people to really use the qBraid-SDK if you do the
quantum teleporation challenge! If you run into any issues with the SDK, please
let Ryan or Ricky know :) .
